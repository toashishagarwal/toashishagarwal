2. **AI-Finetuning**
<br>A set of working examples that demonstrate the steps involved in finetuning Large Language Models to suit your custom dataset <br>
a) How is Fine-tuning done in Snowflake [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/tree/main/3%20Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Model) & [Medium post](https://toashishagarwal.medium.com/fine-tune-llm-model-using-snowflake-cortex-practical-use-case-5328a3f9038c) <br>
b) How to Fine-tune LLM using PyTorch,PEFT and LoRA algorithm [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/DeepLearningPyTorch/blob/main/DemoFineTuningLLM.ipynb) & [Medium post](https://toashishagarwal.medium.com/how-to-fine-tune-a-llm-using-lora-5fdb6dea11a6)

3. **AI-RAG**
<br>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines information retrieval with generative language models. In simpler terms, it's an approach that helps AI generate more accurate and up-to-date text by incorporating relevant information from external sources. In this tutorial, we use the foundation model from llama (llama2-70b-chat) to query a synthetically generated data about ergonomics. It demonsrates the use of vectors & vector cosine similarity to achieve RAG in Snowflake. The end result is a prioritised list of documents that match the query in descending order of similarity score [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/blob/main/4%20RAG/demoRAG.ipynb)

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**<br>
A portfolio of common business problems solved using modern Machine Learning Algorithms <br>
a) Churn Predictor [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/ChurnPredictor) <br>
b) Customer Segmentation [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/CustomerSegmentation)

4. **Real Time Ingestion Pipeline** <br>
a) Aggregation of STOCK prices -- This project demonstrates the use of Kafka & Spark to ingest synthetically generated stock price data that goes to Kafka topic & is processed by Spark dataframes [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/demoRealTimePipeline)  <br>
b) Automatic calculation of sales per customer as a real time pipeline using Snowflake Dynamic table [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/blob/main/SnowflakeETL_DynamicTables.sql)

5. **Internals of LLMs-Transformers**
This repository contains the basics of writing an LLM transformer. It contains the internals of Self Attention, Causal Attention, Multi Head Attention, etc. [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/InsideLLM-Transformers)
