🌱 Featured Projects
1. **SQL Genie - AI powered assistant for SQL queries**
<br>A Streamlit application that generates & executes Snowflake-compatible SQL from Natural English Language with high degree of accuracy [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI) & [Medium post](https://toashishagarwal.medium.com/from-natural-language-to-sql-approaches-and-challenges-in-text2sql-d1252ff86321)

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques**

- ***A) Finetuning***  
  A set of working examples that demonstrate the steps involved in finetuning Large Language Models to suit your custom dataset.
  - How is Fine-tuning done in Snowflake — [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/tree/main/3%20Fine%20Tuning%20LLM%20Model) & [Medium post](https://toashishagarwal.medium.com/fine-tune-llm-model-using-snowflake-cortex-practical-use-case-5328a3f9038c) <br>
  - How to Fine-tune LLM using PyTorch, PEFT and LoRA algorithm — [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/DeepLearningPyTorch/blob/main/DemoFineTuningLLM.ipynb) & [Medium post](https://toashishagarwal.medium.com/how-to-fine-tune-a-llm-using-lora-5fdb6dea11a6)

- ***B) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)***  
  RAG is a framework that combines information retrieval with generative language models. In simpler terms, it's an approach that helps AI generate more accurate and up-to-date text by incorporating relevant information from external sources.  
  In this tutorial, we use the foundation model from LLaMA (llama2-70b-chat) to query a synthetically generated dataset about ergonomics. It demonstrates the use of vectors & vector cosine similarity to achieve RAG in Snowflake.  
  The end result is a prioritised list of documents that match the query in descending order of similarity score. — [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/blob/main/4%20RAG/demoRAG.ipynb)

- ***C) AI Agent***  
  A working AI agent developed using Langchain and OpenAI that performs three tasks:
  - Summarize a given topic
  - Generate related questions
  - Identify 5–10 key terms on the topic  
  The agents are executed in parallel using Langchain's RunnableParallel async functionality. — [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Langchain/blob/main/agent.py)

3. **Machine Learning Algorithms**<br>
A portfolio of common business problems solved using modern Machine Learning Algorithms <br>
- Churn Predictor [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/ChurnPredictor) <br>
- Customer Segmentation [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/CustomerSegmentation)

4. **Real Time Ingestion Pipeline** <br>
- Aggregation of STOCK prices -- This project demonstrates the use of Kafka & Spark to ingest synthetically generated stock price data that goes to Kafka topic & is processed by Spark dataframes [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/demoRealTimePipeline)  <br>
- Automatic calculation of sales per customer as a real time pipeline using Snowflake Dynamic table [Code](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/Snowflake-AI/blob/main/SnowflakeETL_DynamicTables.sql)
